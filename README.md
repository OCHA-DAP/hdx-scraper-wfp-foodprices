This pipeline connects to the [WFP](http://dataviz.vam.wfp.org/) website via provided [API](https://api.wfp.org/)  and extracts food prices data country by country creating a dataset per country in HDX. It makes in the order of 2000 reads from WFP and 400 read/writes (API calls) to HDX in a one hour period. It saves 2 temporary files per country each less than 2Mb and these are what are uploaded to HDX. In addition a 100Mb file is generated and uploaded to HDX. These files are then deleted. It runs every month.

### Usage

    python run.py

For the script to run, you will need to have a file called .hdx_configuration.yaml in your home directory containing your HDX key eg.

    hdx_key: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    hdx_read_only: false
    hdx_site: prod

 You will also need to supply the universal .useragents.yaml file in your home directory as specified in the parameter *user_agent_config_yaml* passed to facade in run.py. The collector reads the key **hdx-scraper-wfp-foodprices** as specified in the parameter *user_agent_lookup*.

 Alternatively, you can set up environment variables: USER_AGENT, HDX_KEY, HDX_SITE, TEMP_DIR, LOG_FILE_ONLY
### Usage
python run.py

You will need to have a file called .hdxkey in your home directory containing only your HDX key for the script to run. The script was created to automatically register datasets on the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](http://data.humdata.org/) project.
