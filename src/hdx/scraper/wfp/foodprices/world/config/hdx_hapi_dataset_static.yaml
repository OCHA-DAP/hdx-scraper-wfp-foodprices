notes: |
  This dataset contains data obtained from the
  [HDX Humanitarian API](https://hapi.humdata.org/) (HDX HAPI),
  which provides standardized humanitarian indicators designed
  for seamless interoperability from multiple sources.
  The data facilitates automated workflows and visualizations
  to support humanitarian decision making.
  For more information, please see the HDX HAPI
  [landing page](https://data.humdata.org/hapi)
  and
  [documentation](https://hdx-hapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

  Warnings typically indicate corrections have been made to
  the data or show things to look out for. Rows with only warnings
  are considered complete, and are made available via the API.
  Errors usually mean that the data is incomplete or unusable.
  Rows with any errors are not present in the API but are included
  here for transparency.
methodology: "Registry"
caveats: >
  HDX HAPI is refreshed daily, but the source datasets may have different
  update schedules. Please refer to the source datasets for each subcategory
  to verify their specific update frequency.
